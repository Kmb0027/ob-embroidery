Constructors and Inheritance



Generic methods and classes- has an argument that is a data type
good for collections. Not actually generic but are data type specific.


Encryption
3 kinds, 
Hashing - cannot be unencrypted
three types of encryption algorithms- MD5 SHA1 SHA256

Assymetric - 2 keys that are mathematically linked. Encrypted with public key, decrypted with private key.
three types of encryption algorithms- DSA ECDsa RSA

Symmetric - reversible encryption, single key
in SSL, start with assymetric handshake. Server responds with public key. Use public key to encrypt a symmetric key. Private key used to decrypt symmetric key.
three types of encryption algorithms- DES RC2 TripleDES

Serialize and deserialize
good for paralle programming
2 main serializations, interchangable
